### Summary
Most low-end Amiga models only came with *Chip RAM*. "Big Box" models allowed for a different type of memory to be installed, known as *Fast RAM*, where *fast* means that it's dedicated to the main processor, so that it doesn't have to compete with the other chips in order to gain access to it (as is the case with chip RAM). While both Chip and Fast RAM are limited in size, you can have at least a few MB of the latter on all Amigas (usually up to 8), while the former can never exceed 2 MB.

OpenAmiga600FastRamExpansion will allow you to add 4 MB of Fast RAM to your Amiga 600. This way you will be able to run more applications at once and more quickly. If you combine it with [a chip RAM expansion](https://github.com/SukkoPera/OpenAmiga600RamExpansion), you will also be able to run almost all games supported by WHDLoad, pushing the smallest of the Amigas to its limits.

Note that the A600 was not originally designed to support a Fast RAM expansion, which means Commodore didn't provide any connector for it. In theory it could be sandwiched between the CPU and mainboard, as usually done on A500s, but in the A600 the CPU is soldered directly to the mainboard and cannot be removed. Thus the only way to install it is to clip it over the CPU, using a PLCC socket placed upside-down. PLCC sockets are not meant to be used this way, so this is really a bit of a hack and might not even work in all cases. Space around the CPU is quite limited, hence the odd shape of this board.

OpenAmiga600FastRamExpansion is basically a clone of [a RAM expansion produced by Kipper2K a few years ago](http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=64218), based on [an earlier design by lvd/NedoPC](http://lvd.nedopc.com/Projects/a600_8mb/index.html). He has since stopped producing and selling these cards and I thought it was a pity that he didn't open his designs and actually took all of them down, as this card is quite cheap to build and really useful. So I set about recreating it from scratch.

### Memory Compatibility
The required RAM Type is 16 Mbit (1MÃ—16) DRAM in the SOJ-42 package with up to 70-80 ns access time. It is 5v-only DRAM (not SD(!)RAM) often found in old 72-pin SIMMs, EDO chips might work or not. All chips having *8160* in their part number should be OK.

RAM chips can either be soldered directly to the board or installed in sockets. While soldering the chips might not be trivial for the unexperienced, sockets for the SOJ-42 package are hard to find and not really easier to solder either, so the choice is up to you.

### Assembly and Installation
Open your A600, doing your best not to crack any of the small tabs that hold the case together. If your A600 has the top part of the shielding, remove it and store it somewhere, as you will not be able to put it back in place when the expansion is installed. The same goes for the HD cradle, sorry.

Lots of A600s (and of A1200s, for the record) have issues with leaking electrolytic capacitors, therefore I really recommend to inspect them first, while you have your Amiga open. They might be leaking even if your Amiga shows no problems and when it finally will, it might be too late (= expensive) to salvage it. So, if you notice any brownish or black marks around those shiny metal cylinders, get them replaced. It is NOT an easy thing to do, and you need some decent tools anyway, so I really recommend to contact a professional, there are many people on Amiga forums offering this kind of service.

Before soldering the CPU socket you will need to rework it a bit: you should sand down one of its edges, or it will hit resistor R102 that is present in REV 1.5 boards (at least). Thus try to fit it on the CPU (the large square chip with *MC68000* written on it) and see which corner it is. Make sure to match the correct orientation: one of the corners of the chip is cut and, if you look at the socket, one of its corners will match that.

Besides that, most PLCC sockets have some sort of "stand-offs" on the bottom (which is going to be our top), which you are recommended to sand down, too. I also suggest to clean the CPU pins if possible, using contact cleaner or isopropyl alcool, as all sorts of gunk have probably gathered on them over the years. Let them dry well then. All of this should hopefully make the socket fit better on the chip. 

After you solder the socket, you can cut the bottom of it so that the window in the PCB continues through the socket. Most sockets will already have holes on the bottom that will make this operation easier. This will allow you to install a 14x14mm heatsink on the CPU, which might be a good idea since installing the board will somewhat reduce the heat dissipation capabilities of the chip. Make sure to use good thermal adhesive/glue, otherwise you risk to make the dissipation even worse.

Normally it is not necessary to mount all the decoupling capacitors. I usually skip C4 and C7. Maybe capacitor C13 can be left out as well, your choice. You also free not to install power led LD1, if so you prefer. In case, skip R4 too.

After everything has been soldered, just install the expansion. Push it down firmly until it feels solidly in place but don't force it.

Before reassembling your case, I recommend to run [SysTest](https://github.com/keirf/Amiga-Stuff). Use the Memory option (<kbd>F1</kbd>), it must show 4 MB of Fast RAM. Then start the Memory Test (<kbd>F1</kbd> again) and let it run for 50-100 rounds: if it doesn't find any errors, you are probably good to go. If you get any errors, power off your computer and try to give the expansion a better fit, by pushing it further down or twisting it slightly back and forth.

It might happen that the board slowly works its way out of the socket over time. To avoid this you can anchor it to the mainboard using the hole to the left of the CPU, which should align with one of the holes for the HD cradle legs.

### Support the Project
Since the project is open you are free to get the PCBs made by your preferred manufacturer, however in case you want to support the development, you can order them from PCBWay through this link:

[![PCB from PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/project/img/images/frompcbway.png)](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/OpenAmiga600FastRamExpansion_V1.html)

You get my gratitude and cheap, professionally-made and good quality PCBs, I get some credit that will help with this and [other projects](https://www.pcbway.com/project/member/shareproject/?bmbid=41100). You won't even have to worry about the various PCB options, it's all pre-configured for you!

Also, if you still have to register to that site, [you can use this link](https://www.pcbway.com/setinvite.aspx?inviteid=41100) to get some bonus initial credit (and yield me some more).

Again, if you want to use another manufacturer, feel free to, don't feel obligated :).
