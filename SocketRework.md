The hardest thing to achieve for XXX is a good fit on the CPU for the socket.

Some people recommend using an [Augat PCS-068A](https://octopart.com/search?q=PCS-068A) socket and say it's the socket that is used on Furia cards, which admittedly fit very well on the CPU.

Whatever socket you use, it won't fit very well, because we're using it differently to how it was designed. You can get a much better fit if you sand its surface down until it is level with the tips of the metal pins. This allows it to sit lower on the 68000 and grip the pins better.

This is what you have to do:

1. Remove the small nubs (highlighted in red) from the inside of the socket so that the inner of the socket is totally flat.

2. Put a sheet of sandpaper on a table and rub the socket on it until the edge of the socket (highlighted in red) is level with the tips of the internal metal pins (highlighted in yellow). Only ~0.5mm to ~1mm usually needs removing depending on the socket.

3. File out a small notch in the corner of the socket to allow for socket to sit over the SMD resistor on the motherboard. Highlighted in the image Notch.jpg.

Hopefully your socket will now have a better fit!
